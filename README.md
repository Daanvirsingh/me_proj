# Hand crafter by me(hehe)

2 simple things i implemented here:

1st- grad_desc.py - This is the fundamental of machine learning, if you understand gradient descent then you know how machine learning works.

2nd- snake.py - created the snake game in python using pygame. It was very interesting to make it myself.
